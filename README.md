# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: <b>SQL Injection (SQLi):</b>
The user can inject SQL code into the Salesperson page via URL parameters by requesting salesperson.php?id=' OR SLEEP(5)=0--'.
To prevent this, the other sites must be sanatizing the URL input parameters with most likely mysql_real_escape_string().

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: <b>Username Enumeration:</b> 
The Login page shows a bold text error message if the username is correct and a plain text error message if the username is incorrect. 
To prevent this, the other sites displayed the same message if the username was correct or incorrect.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: <b>Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):</b> 
The user can access information pertaining to a Salesperson that isn't on the list by using id = 10 or id = 11 in the URL. 
To prevent this, the other sites redirect back to the Territories page if an illegal id request is made.

Vulnerability #2: __________________
